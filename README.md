# PHPPortVulnerabilityScanner
A Port scanner coded in PHP, this script can be used to scan for open port vulnerability on internal or external networks simply by plugging in the Host IP and Ports. You can code it to include HTML textfields instead of hardcoded ports & IP but to keep it simple and quick mine will be hardcoded.
